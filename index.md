## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorm

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered this quarter is the application of digital twin models to physiological time series data. I found it fascinating how digital twins can create dynamic, patient-specific representations of physiological states, enabling real-time monitoring, simulation, and prediction of health outcomes. The integration of multimodal data and signal processing techniques further enhances the accuracy and adaptability of these models in personalized healthcare.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For my Quarter 2 Project, I’d like to investigate how multimodal health data (such as ECG, EHR, and waveform data) can be integrated to improve early detection of cardiac dysfunctions. Specifically, I want to explore how different types of data contribute to prediction accuracy and whether combining them yields significant performance improvements over single-source models.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In my current project, I would improve the preprocessing pipeline by implementing more robust filtering and normalization techniques for ECG signals. This would help reduce noise and standardize data across patients, ultimately improving model generalizability and reducing bias.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’m interested in experimenting with deep learning architectures such as LSTMs or Transformers for time series modeling. Additionally, I’d like to explore attention mechanisms for interpretability, as they could help identify which portions of the signal contribute most to model predictions.
